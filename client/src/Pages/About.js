          Hanfu is the traditional style of clothing worn by the Han Chinese.
        </p>
        <p>
          Hanfu developed into a variety of styles using fabrics that
          encompassed a number of complex textile production techniques. Hanfu
          has influenced the traditional clothing of many neighboring cultures,
          including the Korean hanbok, the Japanese kimono, the Okinawan ryusou,
          and the Vietnamese áo giao lĩnh. Up to a certain extent, hanfu has
          also influenced some elements in Western fashion, especially those
          influenced by Chinoiserie fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nowadays, the hanfu is gaining recognition as the traditional clothing
          of the Han ethnic group and has experienced a growing fashion revival
          among young Han Chinese people in China and in the overseas Chinese
          diaspora.
